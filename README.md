# E-Store

E-Store is an e-commerce website where users can add products to the cart, delete products, update quantities, and purchase products.
- The project is built using React, leveraging React states like Redux Toolkit and Context API. 
- Redux Persist is used to store data in localStorage for a better user interface.
-  The styling is handled using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, animations with @midudev/tailwind-animations, icons from Heroicons, and alerts with React Toastify.
-  Data fetching is managed by Axios and the Redux createAsyncThunk method, using the API from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products).
